The cults of the Ascendants appear to the common guardsmen to have no true co-ordination amongst heretics. This is why they're oft the first victims.
PSYDON yet lives. PSYDON yet ENDURES.
Dae is far less dangerous than Night; Unholy abberations are abjured by the Absolute Order's gaze.

I can jump further by getting a running start. Mind the overshoot.
Not even His devout truly know the machinations of Abyssor, for He entered an eternal slumber shortly after his ascension.

The origin of werewolves have been lost to time, as it's hard to ask questions of a slavering beast with your throat between its jaws.

Xylix and Matthios both stand for freedom. But what is true freedom?
Astrata and Noc are often misinterpreted as one being. The Equilibrium of the Eclipse is real, however.

The land of Naledi is now but a smouldering ruin of rot and feces; sand runs through with daemonic taint. The warscholars flee their home, weeping as He does.
I AM OLDER THAN AEON. I AM SIN, FATHER OF LIES. I HAVE GONE BY MANY NAMES. SAY THEM AND WEEP, FOR I AM ALL THAT THEY ARE.
Working yourself to death is considered an act worthy of veneration for Malumites—so long as you finish your creation.

Under the Heavens and the Many Stars, there are darker things than men may dream of.
Lupians make exceptional zealots. Ask the Otavan Inquisition.
Stories tell that Noc stole Dendor's curse to create Humen of his own, and thus Lupians came to be. A poor imitation.
Stories tell that Noc stole Dendor's blessing to create Humen of his own, and thus Lupians came to be. An honest attempt.
Solitary Lupians who suffer from gigantism are often mistaken for werevolves and shot without question, so they travel in packs - be it with their own or other peoples.

One does not need to be devout, even those unbelieving can get caught by the predaceous dream of Abyssor. It consumes them, unable to tell his realm apart from their own. Yet suddenly, everything seems possible.
The Ten are both Saints and Gods, the original Aasimar and the shepherds of the new age.
Not all who wish to ascend to godhood are evil. Just most of them.
